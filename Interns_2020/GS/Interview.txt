What are the differences between Matlab and Python ..??

If you want to explain about CSS to a 10-year-old kid. How would you do it.?

----------Round 1 End-----------


I answered all his questions and was selected for the second round.
But as the GS people had to leave fast they selected people from the people they interviewed in the second round.
For many people like though we were selected for the second round interview was not conducted.
