Coding Round:  Solved 2 out of 3 Questions. I was shortlisted for interviews.

--------------Round 1----------------
They asked me basic questions on my resume like what did you do in this project, etc.
What is reverse-proxy??

Basic Coding Question:
Add to the two linked lists given, (i.e)
A: 1->2->3, B: 7->8->9
C = A + B (i.e) C: 9->1->2
I was asked to code it.

I solved it. But it took me around 1/2 hr because I didnot check the test cases which I have given to test my code.
There were mistakes in that test case. Due to this, it took long to debug the small error in my code.
Eventually, I did not get selected to the next round in this
